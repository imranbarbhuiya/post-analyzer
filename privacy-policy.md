# Privacy Policy for X Post Analyzer

**Last updated: August 15, 2025**

## Overview

X Post Analyzer is a Chrome extension for x.com (formerly Twitter) that checks your post content before allowing you to submit. All analysis is performed by sending your post content to OpenAI's API using your own API key and system prompt, which are mandatory for the extension to function. These credentials are stored in your browser's Chrome storage and are never sent to the extension author or any third-party server other than OpenAI. This privacy policy explains how the extension handles your data.
